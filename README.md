# Personal-Projects

  This repository is a collection of personal projects that I have worked on. If you see any errors or room for improvement, let me know! I'm a student at the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy in Camp Lejeune, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skill in software development.
